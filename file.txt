INTRODUCTION :
An airline reservation system is part of the so-called passenger service systems, which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger. ARS eventually evolved into the computer reservations system. A computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and interfaces with a global distribution system which supports travel agencies and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system.
Today all persons are busy with their schedule and no one have time to make a trip for holidays with their family. And this Airline Reservation Process is very difficult to understand in General meaning. But we are providing a Solution for that Problem. This system provides a facility to easy access towards a customers and a real time users. They can easily connected through it and just 3 steps. There is no requirement for any type of Agent. We are giving a all this facility in one project Airline Reservation System.
The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the "Departure city" and "Arrival city" for a particular departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the flight's details such as flight no, name, price and duration of journey etc.
OVERVEIW OF THE PROJECT:
The Airline Reservation System project is an implementation of a general Airline Ticketing website like Orbitz, which helps the customers to search the availability of flights, book and cancel the flight tickets. This project also covers adding, deleting or modifying the customer details and flights. In general, this website would be designed to perform like any other airline ticketing website available online.
PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:
The purpose of this project is to implement or to design a database for an airline reservation system to check the flight details, book and cancel flight tickets. It makes the process of booking and cancelling flight tickets simple and easy for the passengers.
PROBLEM DEFINITION:
Normally a person wants to reserve his ticket and he has to contact at nearest Overseas Travels branch. The Airline Reservation System provides an interface to schedule flights and reservations for an airline through internet. Its responsibility is to keep track of system users, customers, Airbus information, flight information and cancellation
PLAN AND SCOPE:
Airline Reservation System is one the modifications that were carried out in the Passenger Service System so that the working and availability of Service area can be broadened. On one hand, it helps the customers and on the other, it also makes the life of the airline service companies easier by keeping all the records of the passengers and if there is any change in the fight due to some reason, the passengers are promptly informed. This system is also used by companies to keep track of user preferences of regular travelers so that they can provide better service and give offers to customers.
ADVANTAGES OF THIS SYSTEM
•	The proposed system due to computerized is much faster in reservation process, cancellation process and transactions.
•	Transfer of information from various branches would become easier and faster.
•	  Managing and maintaining data becomes easier and cost effective due to very high amount and reliability of storage space available in the proposed system.
